## üóÇ Project Documentation

### The Problem

The Notting Hill neighbourhood management approached us to help them create an online blog, dedicated to dog owners in the community.

Ever since the lockdown, many dog owners struggle to keep their beloved pets to stay groomed or in shape, pet groomers are also hard to find in the area and some, unfortunately, have to close their business down.

### The Blog Purpose

The online blog will be used mainly as a platform to share and find step-by-step DIY dog grooming instructions. It can be accessed by the Notting Hill neighbourhood community as well as other people interested in the DIY dog grooming. Anyone including professional groomers can register and share their tips and tricks. Additionally, professional dog groomers can promote their services and possibly be contacted when their service is needed.

### Target Audience

The target audience is divided into four groups:

1. **Dog owners** who <u>want to share</u> their grooming skills

2. **Professional dog groomers** who also <u>want to promote</u> their services and talents
3. **Dog owners** who are interested in DIY dog grooming and <u>looking for tips/tricks</u> and help for their beloved dogs.
4. General and especially **dog lovers**

### User Personas & User Stories

In the initial market research, we selected some of our user personas and their stories to help us understand their needs to determine the blog features and functionalites development. Outlined below, are the revised the user stories based on the feedback received.

### Dataflow Diagram

The flow of data starts at **Guest** and ends with **Liking the Post**.

The diagram is labeled with numbers so that it is easier to follow:

- Guest will either create an account (1) or login (1.5).
- Everyone can view posts made by registered users (2).
- Guest must sign up (1) for more features.
- Users have access to more features:
  - They can create their own posts (4),
    - They can edit their own posts (4.4)
    - and delete them later (4.2).
  - Users can also comment (6) and like (6.5) on their own posts and other's posts.
- `State` is the local redux state that will communicate with the external API which are the Mongo `Users` and Mongo `Posts`.

### Application Architecture Diagram

![AAD](./docs/diagrams/aad.png)

There are three entities: the client side (front-end), server side (back-end) and the database.

#### Client Side (front-end)

![client side](./docs/diagrams/aad_a.png)

- The front end is in React JS with Material UI library.

- We will deploy on Netlify.

- State management will be handled by React Redux

- Axios will be used to communicate to the backend.

#### Server Side (back-end) & Database

![backend](./docs/diagrams/aad_b.png)

- The backend is in Node JS, to be deployed on Heroku.
- We will use Express.js and it's router to receive and send back response to communicate with the backend.
- For our security, we are leaning towards JSON web tokens and Bcrypt.
- Mongoose will be used to manipulate the collections in the actual MongoDB.
